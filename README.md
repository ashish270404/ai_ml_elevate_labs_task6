# ai_ml_elevate_labs_task6

This task demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for a multi-class classification problem using the Iris dataset. The workflow includes loading and exploring the dataset, preprocessing by normalizing features with StandardScaler, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. A KNN classifier is trained using Scikit-learnâ€™s KNeighborsClassifier, and the model is evaluated over different values of K (from 1 to 20) to determine the optimal number of neighbors based on accuracy. The performance is measured using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Finally, decision boundaries are visualized using two selected features (Petal Length and Petal Width) after encoding the class labels numerically, allowing clear insight into how KNN separates the classes in feature space.
